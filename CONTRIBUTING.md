2. **Be Documented** — every feature/update should include docs (README, code docstrings, architecture notes).  
3. **Be Ethical** — respect **CARE** (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics) and **FAIR** principles.  
4. **Be Testable** — unit/integration tests included for all new functionality.
