Contributing to WDE

Thank you for helping build the World Discovery Engine (WDE) ‚Äî an open, reproducible, ethically-aware AI pipeline for archaeology and earth systems.
This document sets expectations and provides practical steps for contributing.

‚∏ª

1. Ground Rules
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Small, focused PRs with clear purpose.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Deterministic pipelines ‚Äî control seeds (numpy, torch, random) and log all configs.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ No large binaries in Git. Use DVC for data/artifacts, or link to open repositories (see datasets.md).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Always run make lint test before pushing.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Follow ethical guardrails in ETHICS.md ‚Äî e.g., coarsen coordinates, flag Indigenous sovereignty.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Respect Kaggle reproducibility: notebook + CC-0 licensed data only Ôøº.

2. Developer Setup
	1.	Install Poetry:

pipx install poetry


	2.	Install dependencies (with all extras):

poetry install --with dev,geo,ml,viz,notebook


	3.	Install hooks:

poetry run pre-commit install


	4.	Initialize DVC:

poetry run dvc init



Optional: use Docker (Dockerfile) for a reproducible environment Ôøº.

3. Branching & Commits
	‚Ä¢	Branch naming:
	‚Ä¢	feature/<slug> for new features
	‚Ä¢	fix/<slug> for bugfixes
	‚Ä¢	docs/<slug> for documentation
	‚Ä¢	Conventional commits preferred:
	‚Ä¢	feat:, fix:, docs:, ci:, test:, refactor:, chore:.
	‚Ä¢	Update configs under configs/ when changing pipeline behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Document new datasets or sources in datasets.md.

‚∏ª

4. Testing & CI/CD
	‚Ä¢	Run all tests:

poetry run pytest


	‚Ä¢	Coverage reports:

poetry run pytest --cov=wde


	‚Ä¢	Unit tests for every module (tests/unit/) and integration tests for each pipeline stage (tests/integration/).
	‚Ä¢	CI (GitHub Actions) runs linting, tests, and refutation checks (causal falsification) Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid network-dependent tests unless mocked.

‚∏ª

5. Data & Secrets
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not commit credentials or .env files. Use .env.example for templates.
	‚Ä¢	Document every dataset in datasets.md with:
	‚Ä¢	Source URL / API
	‚Ä¢	License
	‚Ä¢	CRS, resolution, coverage
	‚Ä¢	Transform steps (linked to configs/preprocess.yaml) Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Large datasets ‚Üí use DVC remotes (S3, GCS, SSH).

‚∏ª

6. Code Style & Structure
	‚Ä¢	Python ‚â• 3.11
	‚Ä¢	Formatters: ruff + black + isort (enforced via pre-commit).
	‚Ä¢	Modular design: follow world_engine/ pipeline stages (ingest, detect, evaluate, verify, report) Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Keep functions pure where possible; document side effects.
	‚Ä¢	Log everything: configs, seeds, data versions, anomalies, and refutations.

‚∏ª

7. PR Checklist
	‚Ä¢	Code linted (make lint)
	‚Ä¢	Tests pass locally (make test)
	‚Ä¢	Added/updated configs (configs/*.yaml)
	‚Ä¢	Updated docs (README.md, docs/, or datasets.md)
	‚Ä¢	No large binaries in Git
	‚Ä¢	Ethical guardrails respected (ETHICS.md)
	‚Ä¢	Kaggle notebook reproducibility intact

‚∏ª

8. Governance
	‚Ä¢	Code of Conduct: see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
	‚Ä¢	Maintainers may request refactor/split of large PRs.
	‚Ä¢	Ethics overrides: if a dataset, method, or output violates community/Indigenous norms, maintainers may block its merge Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Decisions prioritize:
	1.	Archaeological significance
	2.	Reproducibility
	3.	Ethical defensibility

üîç Reminder: Every PR should enhance clarity, reproducibility, and ethics.
The World Discovery Engine is not just a pipeline ‚Äî it‚Äôs a shared scientific instrument.
