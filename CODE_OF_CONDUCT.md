# üåç World Discovery Engine (WDE) ‚Äî Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct defines the standards of behavior expected from all members of the **World Discovery Engine (WDE)** community: contributors, maintainers, reviewers, users, and collaborators. It exists to **foster an open, safe, respectful, and scientifically rigorous environment** in which archaeology, geoscience, and AI development can flourish ethically and collaboratively.

---

## 1. Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in WDE a **harassment-free, inclusive, and collaborative experience** for everyone, regardless of:

- Age, body size, disability, ethnicity, visible or invisible differences
- Gender identity or expression, sexual orientation
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Nationality, geographic location, language, or cultural background
- Indigenous status, community affiliation, or research domain

We are committed to building a **respectful, interdisciplinary, and globally diverse community** centered on **open science, reproducibility, and ethical responsibility**.

---

## 2. Our Standards

### Examples of positive behavior expected:

- **Respectful collaboration**: Value others‚Äô ideas, expertise, and contributions.
- **Scientific rigor**: Share methods, configs, and datasets transparently for reproducibility.
- **Ethics-first mindset**: Acknowledge and respect Indigenous sovereignty, cultural heritage, and CARE principles in archaeological data.
- **Inclusivity**: Invite and encourage participation from underrepresented groups.
- **Constructive feedback**: Critique ideas, not people. Suggest improvements kindly and with evidence.
- **Credit**: Give proper attribution to data providers, contributors, and communities.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any form.
- Demeaning or exclusionary comments, jokes, or imagery.
- Publishing private information (e.g., Indigenous site coordinates) without permission.
- Scientific misconduct: falsifying results, misrepresenting provenance, or ignoring reproducibility requirements.
- Data colonialism: exploiting archaeological or Indigenous data without respect, benefit-sharing, or permissions.
- Disruptive trolling, spamming, or attempts to derail project discussions.

---

## 3. Enforcement Responsibilities

- **Maintainers** are responsible for clarifying community standards, monitoring behavior, and enforcing this Code of Conduct consistently.
- Maintainers may take **corrective and protective actions** appropriate to the situation, including:
  - Warnings (public or private)
  - Temporary or permanent bans from contributions
  - Blocking PRs, issues, or access
  - Reporting egregious violations to affiliated institutions, funders, or Kaggle moderators

---

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- The **GitHub repository** (issues, PRs, discussions, CI/CD logs)
- **Kaggle notebooks/datasets** published as part of WDE
- **Community channels** (Slack, forums, email, events)
- **Offline interactions** in community or scientific settings where WDE is represented

---

## 5. Reporting & Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. Report to the maintainers **privately**: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for contact channels.
2. Reports will be handled **confidentially, respectfully, and within 14 days**.
3. The enforcement team is required to **recuse themselves** from handling incidents where they have a conflict of interest.
4. Retaliation against reporters will **not be tolerated**.

---

## 6. Scientific & Ethical Integrity

Because WDE deals with **archaeological and environmental data**, additional responsibilities apply:

- **Reproducibility**: All results must be accompanied by config files, seeds, and dataset citations.
- **Ethics compliance**: Indigenous sovereignty checks, coordinate masking, and CARE principles are non-optional.
- **Open licensing**: Only use datasets under open, CC-0, or compatible licenses. Respect non-commercial restrictions.
- **Attribution**: Always cite ESA, NASA, USGS, Planet NICFI, ISRIC, or any other dataset providers as required.

---

## 7. Attribution

This Code of Conduct builds upon:

- [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)
- [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://www.gida-global.org/care)
- Best practices from open-source, reproducible science, and archaeology ethics

---

## 8. Acknowledgement

By contributing to WDE, you acknowledge:

- You have read, understood, and agreed to this Code of Conduct.
- Violations may result in corrective action, up to removal from the community.
- You will uphold WDE‚Äôs mission: **to discover, document, and preserve with openness, reproducibility, and respect.**
