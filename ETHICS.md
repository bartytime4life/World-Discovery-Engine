# WDE Ethics & Responsible Research

WDE surfaces potentially sensitive archaeological candidates. Responsible use is mandatory.

## Principles
1. **Do No Harm** — Avoid enabling looting, disturbance, or misappropriation of cultural heritage.
2. **Community Respect** — Engage with local and indigenous communities; follow informed guidance.
3. **Data Minimization** — Share only what is necessary; coarsen/blur precise coordinates in public artifacts.
4. **Provenance & Uncertainty** — Include uncertainty and limitations in every dossier; document sources and transforms.
5. **Legal Compliance** — Adhere to data licenses, national regulations, and site protection laws.

## Publication Norms
- Public releases should avoid precise site coordinates unless expressly permitted.
- WDE outputs must include context, caveats, and refutation attempts.

## Access Controls
- Treat high-risk layers (exact site locations, fragile sites) as restricted; use access tiers or private remotes.

## Appeals & Oversight
- If stakeholders raise concerns, pause dissemination and convene maintainers + advisors to review.
