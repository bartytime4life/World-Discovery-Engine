abstract: >
  The World Discovery Engine (WDE) is a modular, reproducible AI pipeline for archaeology
  and earth systems. It integrates multi-modal data (optical, SAR, LiDAR, DEM, soil, hydrology,
  historical texts) to detect archaeologically significant sites such as Anthropogenic Dark Earths
  (ADEs) and geoglyphs. WDE outputs candidate site dossiers with uncertainty quantification,
  multi-proof validation, causal plausibility graphs, and provenance logs. It is designed for
  Kaggle reproducibility, CI/CD workflows, and ethical compliance with Indigenous data governance
  and CARE principles.
